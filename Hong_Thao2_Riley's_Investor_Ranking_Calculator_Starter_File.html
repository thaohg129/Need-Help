// Please review the directions for the program (below).  This will explain what the program is
// supposed to do.  While much of the program has been provided, some parts of the program are 
// missing.  The missing parts are indicated with question marks ("ï¿½").  Your goal is to update
// the program by replacing all of the question marks with code which will make the program 
// function properly.
//
// Riley certainly found some great investors! These investors have vision and they have the
// financial resources to make a difference. Some of Riley's investors are very problematic from a risk perspective!
// Too often these problematic investors are excited about Riley's business 
// but simply don't have the financial resources to be a serious investor.  Some of 
// them simply don't have enough assets. Some of them just have too much debt. While others 
// don't have enough income. There may even be investors with both debt and income issues.  
//
// Riley determined that she needs a tool to qualify these investors. This tool needs to determine if they 
// have enough of the financial resources to be a serious investor.  The requirements Riley identified include 
// the following: Investors must have enough assets; Investors will need to have low enough debt; Investors will
// need to have income to be a serious investor.  Riley would like you to develop this tool.  
//
// This program will be similar to the other programs you have written for this class, the main program and the
// function declarations are provided.  Your job will be to write the code inside 
// the functions to solve the problem (you will need to write three functions).
// These three functions are:
//
//		totalAssets() - The totalAssets() function will not be passed any parameters. It
//			will prompt the user for the number of assets that the user has (i.e. bank
//			accounts, investment accounts, etc.) and will then use a "for" loop to prompt
//			the user for the value of each of these assets and will keep a running 
//			total of these assets.  The function will return the total value of all assets.
//          The loop should continue for the amount of assets the user identifies.
//
//		totalDebt() - The totalDebt() function will not be passed any parameters.  Unlike
//			the totalAssets() function, totalDebt() will not use a "for" loop.
//          totalDebt() will use a while loop. totalDebt() will prompt the user for the value of 
//          each debt the user has and will continue asking for the value of the next debt until
//          the user enters a value of "0".  totalDebt() will keep a running total of debt and when
//          the user enters a debt of "0" the function will return the total debt.
//
//		calculateInvestorRanking(investmentAmount, annualIncome, assets, debts) - calculateInvestorRanking()
//			is passed four parameters.  These four parameters are:
//				investmentAmount - Represents the amount of the proposed investment.  For smaller
//					investment, the investor will not need the same type of finanacial resources
//					as for larger investments.  This has been provided in the main program.
//				annualIncome -  Represents the annual income of the prospective investor. This
//					has been provided in the main program.  
//				assets - The total assets of the prospective investor.  This is returned by the 
//					totalAssets() function.  
//				debts - The total debts of the prospective investor.  This is returned by the 
//					totalDebt() function.  
//			Using these four pieces of information, calculateInvestorRanking will return an "investor 
//			score" based on the following rules:
//				1) If the prospective investor's debts are greater than their assets then the investor 
//					score is 0 because this investor is clearly broke.
//				2) If the difference between the investor's assets and the investor's debts (assets-debts)  
//					is less than the investment amount then the investor score is 0 because, while this investor 
//					isn't broke, they clearly don't have the financial assets to make this kind of investment.
//				3) After subtracting debts and the proposed investment from assets, the investor   
//					needs money to live on.  If the balance of their assets 
//					(total assets - total debts - proposed investment) is greater than annual income, the investor score would 
// 					be (total assets - total debts - proposed investment).
